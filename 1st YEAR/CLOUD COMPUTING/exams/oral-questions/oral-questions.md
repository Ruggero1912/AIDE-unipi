    - Hypercalls and how evoids emulation (Xen platform)
- Hypervisor
    > Typologies
    > Baremetal and Host
    > What type do you choose if you have 50k of the same VMs ? 
- Container
    > Difference between Container and VM
- Type of service for a Cloud Provider

- Workflow to create new container in Docker and launching
    > How does exposing a container to the outside work on Docker? What does exposing a container to the outside mean and what does this operation involve?
- What's libvirt or kvm ?
    > How does instantiating a virtual machine using libvirt/kvm work? What should I do?
    > From a network perspective, how does it work? On which networks are virtual machines inserted?
- Workflow of Kubernates 
    > What is the OpenStack installation process?
