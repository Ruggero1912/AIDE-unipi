## 2020 Complete collection of questions

From a message in the Telegram group of Cloud Computing, July 2022:
>Vallati:
>- Cloud structure and architectures (slides C-01)
>- Does a Load Balancing cluster provide availability and redundancy? Yes. Why do we use High Avalibility clusters instead, then? Because LB clusters are less efficient to duplicate data, since every node in the tier has to communicate with all the other nodes of the tier
>- Explain hardware pass-through
>- Explain how autoscaling works in Kubernetes
>
>Tonellotto:
>- Explain distributed sorting

>Per chi fosse interessato, domande Vallati:
>- Definizione di cloud platform + spiegazione servizi OpenStack
>- Come funziona ceph?
>- Sai dirmi alcuni comandi che abbiamo visto di Docker? 
>
>Domande Tonellotto:
>- Parlami degli RDD, qual è la sua caratteristica principale? (Immutabilità)
>- Quando viene creata la lineage di un RDD? (Alla prima trasformazione)
>- Parlami del Task Interaction Graph
>
>Ha fatto anche una quarta domanda Tonellotto (1 per persona) ma non me la ricordo
