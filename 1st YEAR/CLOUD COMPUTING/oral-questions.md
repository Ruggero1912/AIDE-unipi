## 2020 Complete collection of questions

From a message in the Telegram group of Cloud Computing, July 2022:
>Vallati:
>- Cloud structure and architectures (slides C-01)
>- Does a Load Balancing cluster provide availability and redundancy? Yes. Why do we use High Avalibility clusters instead, then? Because LB clusters are less efficient to duplicate data, since every node in the tier has to communicate with all the other nodes of the tier
>- Explain hardware pass-through
>- Explain how autoscaling works in Kubernetes
>
>Tonellotto:
>- Explain distributed sorting
