# AIDE @ unipi
Students' material for the course in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at University of Pisa. 

Use this repo to search for **slides**, **students' notes** and information about the course's exams 
(**exams methods**, oral **questions**, **past exams**, link to past **students projects** ...).

>All the material you can find here has to be considered as unofficial. All the content is made by the students for the students. The material is checked only by the students. Please signal errors or problems (issue panel).<br/>
All what you will find there is provided as **non-profit**.

### 🌟 If you find a project **useful** or **well made**, please leave a star in its repo! 🌟

You can add material by performing a pull request, opening an issue or by contacting one of the mantainers.

If you want to contribute to this repo, in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Ruggero1912/AIDE-unipi/issues) you can find an (hopefully) updated list of missing things.

Every contribution will be very appreciated and mentioned in the credits.

Acknowledged contributors are the ones whose contributions list is quoted.<br/>
If your contribution or the one of someone you know is not acknowledged, please DM a mantainer to confirm or reject your presence (we did not manage to contact you). <br/>
Project links usually need contribution confirmation if it is a new contributor, while oral questions reported on a group usually do not require a confirmation.

If you want to be added to the contributors list or to be removed,
 write to the mantainers.
