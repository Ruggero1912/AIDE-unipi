# AIDE-unipi
Students' material for the course in Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering at University of Pisa. 

Use this repo to search for **slides**, **students' notes** and information about the course's exams 
(**exams methods**, oral **questions**, **past exams**, link to past **students projects** ...).

Every contribution will be very appreciated and mentioned in the credits.

You can add material by performing a pull request, opening an issue or by contacting one of the mantainers.

*This is repo was inspired by the one available for the [Computer Engineering course at UniPi](https://github.com/Guray00/IngegneriaInformatica)*.
