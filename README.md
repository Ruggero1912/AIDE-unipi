Acknowledged contributors are the ones whose contributions list is quoted.<br/>
If your contribution or the one of someone you know is not acknowledged, please DM a mantainer to confirm or reject your presence (we did not manage to contact you). <br/>
Project links usually need contribution confirmation if it is a new contributor, while oral questions reported on a group usually do not require a confirmation.

If you want to be added to the contributors list or to be removed,
 write to the mantainers.
