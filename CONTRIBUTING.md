### Contributing Guidelines

If you are reading this it means that you want to help this repository development, thank you!

#### Adding link to one of your projects' repo
If you want to share the link to one of your university projects public repo, you can open a pull request and modify the file readme.md of the directory of the subject the project was made for.
Please try to give as much information as possible about your newly added project, for example try to indicate:
- all the authors
- the period when you presented the project
- whether the project was appreciated / what the professor said that it could be enhanced
- what the project is about (short description)

The more details you give, much likely the project will be visited and starred.

Try to use the same syntax and formatting of the other project in the list.

In the pull request also add your name and the name of the other members of the group project to the contributors list 
(that you can find in the repo readme.md) if still not present, and add also the project subject and name to your contributions following the syntax of the others contributions.

#### Adding your course's notes

If you want to share the notes that you took for an exam, open a pull request where you:
1. upload the notes (possibly in .pdf format) with a name like (ProfessorName-AAyear-YourName.pdf) inside the folder of the subject the notes are for.
2. add a link to the notes in the readme of the subject following the syntax of the other notes' links (indicate author, number of pages, language, AA, and any other detail that you think could be useful about your notes).
3. like for any other contribution, also add your name to the contributors list (that you can find in the repo readme.md) if still not present, 
and add also the notes' subject and name of your notes following the syntax of the others contributions in the list of your contributions.

Please add only notes that you personally made and / or that you were allowed to share.

#### Adding oral questions

To add known oral questions, please create or update the file oral-questions.md inside the folder of the subject following the syntax of the others oral-questions file. 

(possibly) specify the Appello in which the questions were made, add every detail you remember about the question and / or a good answer to the question (if you can, not required).

like for any other contribution, also add your name to the contributors list (that you can find in the repo readme.md) if still not present, 
and add also the questions' subject (i. e. mobile questions 1st appello june 2022) in the list of your contributions
